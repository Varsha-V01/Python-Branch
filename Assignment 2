Question 1:
Write a Python program to generate the next 15 leap years starting from a given year. Populate the leap years into a list and display the list. 

def leap_year(year):
    if (year%4 == 0):
        if (year%100 == 0):
            if (year % 400 == 0):
                for i in range (0,15):
                    year = year + 4
                    print (year)
        else:
            for i in range (0,15):
                year = year + 4
                print (year)
                         
    else:
        remainder = year % 4
        new_year = year + 4 - remainder
        for i in range (0,15):
            print (new_year)
            new_year = new_year + 4
            
leap_year(2001)

Question 2:
Write a python function to check whether three given numbers can form the sides of a triangle. 
Hint: Three numbers can be the sides of a triangle if none of the numbers are greater than or equal to the sum of the other two numbers.

def triangl(a,b,c):
    if (a+b > c):
        if (b+c > a):
            if (a+c > b):
                print (" triangle")
            else:
                print ("Not a triangle")
        else:
            print ("Not a triangle")
    else:
        print ("Not a triangle")
        
triangl(12, 2, 3) 

Question 3:
The program provided in the starter code tab is written to display “*” as per the expected output given below. But the code is having logical errors, debug the program using Eclipse Debugger and correct it.

Expected Output:
*****
****
***
**
*

for i in range(1,5):
    for j in range (i,5):
        print ('*', end = '')
    print ('')
 

Question 4:
Given a list of integer values. Write a python program to check whether it contains same number in adjacent position. 
Display the count of such adjacent occurrences.

list1 = [10,10,3,4,5,5,5,4]
count = 0
len_list = len(list1)
for i in range (1,len_list):
    if (list1[i-1] == list1[i]):
        count = count+1
        
print (count)
