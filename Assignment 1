Question:
Write a python program to find and display the product of three positive integer values based on the rule mentioned below:
It should display the product of the three values except when one of the integer value is 7. In that case, 7 should not be included in the product and the values to its left also should not be included.
If there is only one value to be considered, display that value itself. If no values can be included in the product, display -1.


Sample Input	Expected Output
1, 5, 3	        15
3, 7, 8	        8
7, 4, 3	        12
1, 5, 7	        -1


def prod_functin(a, b, c):
  
  prod = 1
  if (a == 7):
    prod = b*c
  elif (b == 7):
    prod = c
  elif (a == 7 and c == 7):
    prod = -1
  elif (c == 7 ):
    prod = a
  else:
    prod = a*b*c
    
  return prod
  
print (prod_functin(3, 7, 8))

Question 2:
You have x no. of 5 rupee coins and y no. of 1 rupee coins. You want to purchase an item for amount z. 
The shopkeeper wants you to provide exact change. You want to pay using minimum number of coins. 
How many 5 rupee coins and 1 rupee coins will you use? If exact change is not possible then display -1.


def amount_pay(five_coins,one_coins,amount):
  print ("Number of five Rs coins", five_coins)
  print ("Number of one Rs coins", one_coins)
  no_of_five_needed = int(amount/5)
  no_of_one_needed = amount%5
  
  if (five_coins < no_of_five_needed):
    return -9
  elif (one_coins < no_of_one_needed):
    return -1
  else :
    return no_of_five_needed, no_of_one_needed
    
print ("Number of coins to be paid", amount_pay (4,2,21) )
