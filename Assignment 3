Question1:

Write a python program to generate the ticket numbers for specified number of passengers traveling in a flight as per the details mentioned below:
The ticket number should be generated as airline:src:dest:number
where
Consider AI as the value for airline
src and dest should be the first three characters of the source and destination cities.
number should be auto-generated starting from 101
The program should return the list of ticket numbers of last five passengers.
Note: If passenger count is less than 5, return the list of all generated ticket numbers.

Sample Input	              Expected Output
airline = AI
source = Bangalore
destination = London
no_of_passengers = 10	      ['AI:Ban:Lon:106', 'AI:Ban:Lon:107', 'AI:Ban:Lon:108', 'AI:Ban:Lon:109', 'AI:Ban:Lon:110']
airline = BA
source = Australia
destination = France
no_of_passengers = 2	       ['BA:Aus:Fra:101', 'BA:Aus:Fra:102']



def generate_ticket(airline,source,destination,no_of_passengers):
    ticket_number_list=[]
    count=100
    #Write your logic here
    src = source [0:3]
    des = destination [0:3]
    #Use the below return statement wherever applicable
    for i in range(no_of_passengers,0,-1):
        count=count+1
        ticket= airline+':'+src+':'+des+':'+str(count)
        ticket_number_list.append(ticket)
    return ticket_number_list

#Provide different values for airline,source,destination,no_of_passengers and test your program
print(generate_ticket("AI","Bangalore","London",2))


Question2:
The road transport corporation (RTC) of a city wants to know whether a particular bus-route is running on profit or loss.

Assume that the following information are given:
Price per litre of fuel = 70
Mileage of the bus in km/litre of fuel = 10
Price(Rs) per ticket = 80

The bus runs on multiple routes having different distance in kms and number of passengers.
Write a function to calculate and return the profit earned (Rs) in each route. Return -1 in case of loss.

def generate_ticket(airline,source,destination,no_of_passengers):
    ticket_number_list=[]
    count=100
    #Write your logic here
    src = source [0:3]
    des = destination [0:3]
    #Use the below return statement wherever applicable
    for i in range(no_of_passengers,0,-1):
        count=count+1
        ticket= airline+':'+src+':'+des+':'+str(count)
        ticket_number_list.append(ticket)
    return ticket_number_list


print(generate_ticket("AI","Bangalore","London",2))


Question3:
Given a string containing uppercase characters (A-Z), compress the string using Run Length encoding. Repetition of character has to be replaced by storing the length of that run.

Write a python function which performs the run length encoding for a given String and returns the run length encoded String.

Provide different String values and test your program.

Sample Input	    Expected Output
AAAABBBBCCCCCCCC	4A4B8C
AABCCA	          2A1B2C1A

def len_run(word):
    word = word + ' '
    word_len = len(word)
    new_word=''
    count = 1
    for i in range(1,word_len):
        if (word[i] == word[i-1]):
            count = count + 1
            continue
        else:
            new_word = new_word + str(count) + word[i-1]
            count = 1
            
    return new_word

print(len_run('AABCCA'))


Question4:
Care hospital wants to know the medical speciality visited by the maximum number of patients. Assume that the patient id of the patient along with the medical speciality visited by the patient is stored in a list. The details of the medical specialities are stored in a dictionary as follows:
{
"P":"Pediatrics",
"O":"Orthopedics",
"E":"ENT
} 

Write a function to find the medical speciality visited by the maximum number of patients and return the name of the speciality.
Also write the pytest test cases to test the program.

Note: 
Assume that there is always only one medical speciality which is visited by maximum number of patients.
Perform case sensitive string comparison wherever necessary.

Sample Input	                Expected Output
[101,P,102,O,302,P,305,P]       	Pediatrics
[101,O,102,O,302,P,305,E,401,O,656,O]	  Orthopedics
[101,O,102,E,302,P,305,P,401,E,656,O,987,E]	  ENT

def speciality(input_list):
    
    count_p = 0
    count_o = 0
    count_e = 0
    for i in input_list:
        if (str(i).lower() == 'p'):
            count_p +=1
        elif(str(i).lower() == 'o'):
            count_o +=1
        else:
            count_e +=1
            
    if ( count_e > count_o and count_e > count_p):
        print ("ENT")
    elif ( count_o > count_e and count_o > count_p):
        print("Orthopedics")
    else:
        print("Pediatrics")
        
speciality([101,'O',102,'E',302,'P',305,'P',401,'E',656,'O',987,'E'])

Question5:
Write a python program to display all the common characters between two strings. Return -1 if there are no matching characters.

list1 = [12,20,20,30,30,40,50]
list2 = [12,12,20,20,20,60]

set1 = set(list1)
set2 = set(list2)

common = set1 & set2
print (common)
